Life in this prehistoric dimension
is amazing. I have had the
opportunity to interact with herds
of stegosaurs and witness the
majestic flight of a pterosaur.

Each step in this ancient land
fills me with a feeling of wonder
and humility.

The records in my journal can
barely capture the magnitude of
these experiences.






I have established a base camp
to continue my exploration and
detailed study of the flora and
fauna that inhabit this lost world.
