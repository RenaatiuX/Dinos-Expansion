A close encounter with a
Tyrannosaurus rex has been
a terrifying and exciting
experience.

As he watched from a distance,
a herd of herbivores became
alarmed and began to flee.
My archeological instincts told
me to stay still, but the
adrenaline and excitement made
me run to capture the moment
on my camera.






Although my safety was at risk,
these experiences redefine my
passion for archaeology.

Science and wonder are intertwined
with every step I take in this
unexplored dimension.

I feel grateful for having the
opportunity to be part of
something so momentous.
