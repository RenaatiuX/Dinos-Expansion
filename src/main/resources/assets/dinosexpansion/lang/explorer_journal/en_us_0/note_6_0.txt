I have had the opportunity to
explore ancient caverns in this
dimension.
The murals that adorn its walls
represent scenes of coexistence
between humans and dinosaurs.

The humanoid figures interacting
with these creatures are an
intriguing mystery.

What meaning do these artistic
representations have? Were
they merely symbolic or did
they convey valuable knowledge?




 Each find in these caves reveals
 hidden clues to the history of
 this mysterious place.
