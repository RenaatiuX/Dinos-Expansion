I've lost count of how many
sunrises have seen since I came
into this world. Hundreds,I think,
but each one was better than the
last. Sometimes I like to take
Max out just before dawn and look
at it while I fly through the sky
every morning It is just at that
moment that despite being so simple,
I am someone really lucky.


It's not that I don't like to explore
every part of this place, but I was
never going to find a Diplodocus
stepping on everything in its path
right? Since I arrived here, I
wasted no time and started to
investigate creatures that no other


biologist has seen or will ever see,
I will always be grateful for
everything that it's happening to me.
