My encounter with a community
of native humanoid beings has
been one of the most emotional
moments of this expedition.

Through gestures and sounds,
we have communicated as best
we could.
They seem to have a deep
connection  to dinosaurs and
treat these  creatures with
respect and admiration.

Their ancient knowledge and
wisdom  may be crucial in
unlocking the  mysteries of
this dimension.


I am looking forward to learning
more  about their culture and
sharing  our scientific discoveries
with them.
