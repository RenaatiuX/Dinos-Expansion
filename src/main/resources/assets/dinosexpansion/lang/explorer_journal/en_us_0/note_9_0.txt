I have documented a species
of plant that appears to have
medicinal properties.

The natives use it to alleviate
ailments and improve health.

His knowledge of the flora and
fauna of this dimension is
impressive.

Working with them has enriched me
as an archaeologist and scientist.






Our knowledge exchanges have led
us to a deeper understanding
of the history of this world
and our respective dimensions.
