Date: October 6

During a night observation, I
witnessed an impressive
celestial phenomenon.

A shower of stars lit up the
dark sky, and the glow of the
Milky Way reflected off the
calm waters of a nearby lake.

The beauty of this natural
spectacle reminded me that
despite all the science and
research, there is a sense
of wonder and mystery that
transcends our understanding.




Here, surrounded by dinosaurs
and wonders, I feel connected
to something bigger than
ourselves.
