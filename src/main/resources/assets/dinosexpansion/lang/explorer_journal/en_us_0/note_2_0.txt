He had been waiting for a change
of weather before studying life
wild from the peculiar Tundra
region in this dimension, but
I think I'm sure it's not possible.
It should be noted that this
dimension does not have an axial
tilt and therefore does not have
seasons, for example, snow or ice
does not they melt quickly.

I can't say feeling happy about it.
I have never liked the cold that
is more than confirmed, but I have
nothing left to put up with.

The climate during the Jurassic
and Cretaceous from where many
of these creatures came from this


dimension was quite uniform, so a
frozen region is extremely strange.

It would be stubborn of me not to
have my companions by my side.
