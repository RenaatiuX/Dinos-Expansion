My investigations in this dimension
have taken my understanding of
history to new frontiers. He
discovered not only evidence of
the coexistence of dinosaurs with
intelligent humans, but also
artifacts that suggest that there
was an ancient civilization that
interacted with these magnificent
creatures.

My hands tremble with emotion
when touching these
archaeological treasures.





This finding will change the way
we view history and the
relationship between humans
and dinosaurs.
